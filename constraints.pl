<p>
In this tutorial, we will look more closely at constraints. In SolveSpace,
we will almost always use constraints to specify the geometry of our
sketch. It's also possible just to drag points with the mouse, or to place
them on a regular snap grid; but a careful choice of constraints will make
the design intent of the drawing obvious, and save us from recalculating
the geometry of our part by hand every time a dimension changes.
</p>

<p>
A constraint is a geometric fact about the sketch. For example, a length
constraint tells the solver that a given line segment should have a given
length. The solver will try to move the points and other entities in the
sketch in such a way as to satisfy all the constraints. But depending how
the constraints are specified, it may be impossible for the solver to do
so, or the result may not be the intended solution.
</p>

<p>
In this tutorial, we will constrain a simple sketch, and look at some of
the ways that our constraints can fail.  We start with a triangle,
made from three line segments. The sketch already contains three
constraints: the endpoint of each line segment is joined to the next
using a point-coincident constraint, which was inserted automatically as
we drew the line (by choosing Sketch &rarr; Line Segment, and clicking
vertex A, B, C, and then A again). The point-coincident constraints are
drawn as tiny magenta dots at the centers of the green square points.
</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/constraints-triangle.png">
</div>

<p>
Initially, we can drag any of the three vertices of the triangle. Each
point lies in the XY plane; so each point has two degrees of freedom,
X and Y. This means that the overall sketch has six DOF.
</p>

<p>
We can restrict those degrees of freedom with constraints. Select one
of the line segments by left-clicking it, and choose Constrain &rarr;
Distance. This constrains the length of that edge, initially to whatever
length it was drawn with. We can modify that length by double-clicking
the dimension and typing a new value, and the solver will modify the
sketch accordingly.
</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/constraints-triangle-dim-1.png">
</div>

<p>
This constraint removes one DOF, so the sketch now has five DOF. To
confirm this, go to the home screen in the Property Browser (by pressing Esc,
or clicking the home link at the top left), and select the sketch,
probably g002-sketch-in-plane, from the list. A list of constraints
appears, and the number of degrees of freedom is indicated.
</p>

<p>
We can similarly constrain two internal angles of the triangle,
by left-clicking to select the two adjacent edges and then choosing
Constrain &rarr; Angle for each vertex. Each angle constraint removes
one DOF, so the sketch now has three DOF.
</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/constraints-triangle-dim-2.png">
</div>

<p>
We can still drag any of the three vertices of the triangle, and it will
move; but now the entire triangle moves with it, and the shape of the
triangle does not change. This makes sense. From high school trigonometry,
we know that we can fully describe a triangle by angle-side-angle. This
means that the only degrees of freedom remaining are the translation
(two DOF, X and Y) and rotation (one DOF, rotation theta about the Z
axis) of the triangle, which moves as a rigid body in the plane. So the
triangle should have three DOF, and it does.
</p>

<p>
We could attempt to constrain the length of another side of the triangle,
again by choosing Constrain &rarr; Distance. If we do so, then we see
that the background of the sketch turns red, to indicate an error. In the
Property Browser, we are informed that the solver has failed. This is because
we have attempted to overconstrain the sketch. We had already specified
enough constraints to exactly describe our triangle. This means that
any additional constraints are not useful&mdash;either they are redundant,
in which case they add no information, or they are inconsistent, in which
case they can't ever be satisfied.
</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/constraints-triangle-fail-1.png">
</div>

<p>
As a convenience, SolveSpace determines which constraints could be
removed to fix the problem. Of course, it is possible to fix the problem
by removing the constraint that we have just added, since the sketch was
okay before. But it's also possible to fix the problem by removing one
of the angle constraints, for example. This again makes sense, since we
know that we can fully describe a triangle by side-side-angle.
</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/constraints-triangle-fail-2.png">
</div>

<p>
Note that even though portions of the sketch are overconstrained, it still
has unconstrained degrees of freedom. There are still no constraints that
specify the translation of the triangle with respect to the origin, for
example, or its rotation with respect to the coordinate axes. It would
always be an error if we tried, for example, to constrain five DOF in
a sketch with only four DOF to start with. But it's still possible to
have an error with fewer constraints than degrees of freedom, if those
constraints will overconstrain some DOF and leave others free.
</p>

<p>
If the sketch fails to solve, then it's important to fix the problem
immediately. If more constraints are added while the sketch is
inconsistent, then it will become very difficult to determine what's
wrong. It's always possible to revert to the previous set of constraints
by choosing Edit &rarr; Undo.
</p>

<p>
A related error occurs when the constraints are not inconsistent,
but still cannot be satisfied. Below, we have attempted to draw a
triangle with side lengths 2, 3, and 7. This is impossible, since 2 +
3 = 5 is less than 7&mdash;the triangle cannot be closed. A triangle
could ordinarily be specified in terms of those three line lengths
(side-side-side), but the particular values of the dimensions specified
here are invalid. This causes a different type of error; technically,
the result is that the solution does not converge.
</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/constraints-nonconverging.png">
</div>

<p>
The solver once again reports the error, and once again reports a list
of problematic constraints. By removing one or more of the unsatisfied
constraints, or just by choosing Edit &rarr; Undo, we restore the sketch
to a legal configuration.
</p>

<p>
It was relatively straightforward to count degrees of freedom with our
triangle: each point started with two DOF, and each length or angle
constraint removed one DOF. But for some entities and constraints,
the situation is more complex. A point-symmetry constraint, for example
(Constrain &rarr; Symmetric) fully determines the location of one point
in terms of the location of the other point. Since that point originally
had two degrees of freedom, this means that the constraint must restrict
two DOF, not just one. Most constraints restrict only one DOF, but some
restrict two, and some constraints in 3d restrict three.
</p>

<p>
Sketch entities can be similarly complex. An arc, for example, is drawn
with three points (the circle's center, and the arc's two endpoints),
but it has five degrees of freedom (for example, its center X, center Y,
start angle, finish angle, and radius), not six. Consider the arc shown
below. We've specified its diameter, and we've constrained its center
to lie at the origin (by selecting its center, selecting the origin, and
choosing Constrain &rarr; On Point), and we've constrained the distance
between its endpoints. We now wish to place the two endpoints of the
arc symmetric about the horizontal axis.
</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/constraints-arc-1.png">
</div>

<p>
We might first think to choose Constrain &rarr; Symmetric. But if we do
so, then we will find that the sketch fails to solve. This is correct
behavior, since we have overconstrained the sketch. We can convince
ourselves of this just by counting. The arc started with five degrees of
freedom. We placed its center at the origin, which removed two, leaving
us with three. The diameter constraint removes one more, and the distance
constraint between its endpoints removes another. This leaves us with only
one degree of freedom, and we determined above that the point-symmetry
constraint removes two. It therefore must overconstrain the sketch.
</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/constraints-arc-2.png">
</div>

<p>
We should instead just constrain the two endpoints of the arc to be
aligned vertically (by selecting them, and then choosing Constrain
&rarr; Vertical). This removes only one degree of freedom; and since
the points lie on the circle, by constraining them vertical they also
end up equidistant from the horizontal axis and therefore symmetric.
</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/constraints-arc-3.png">
</div>

<p>
As we've seen, it's very difficult to determine ahead of time exactly how
many degrees of freedom a given portion of a sketch will have, and which
constraints are appropriate. This means that as we draw and constrain the
sketch, we will periodically encounter these types of errors. It's not a
very big problem when we do; we can use the list of failing constraints
(or, if not that, Edit &rarr; Undo) to refine our sketch, and choose
constraints that are correct and reflect our design intent.
</p>

<p>
In some cases, the constraints that we specify will be ambiguous.
Consider the triangle below:
</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/constraints-ambiguous-1.png">
</div>

<p>
One edge of this triangle is horizontal, and another is vertical; so we've
specified one of its angles to be ninety degrees, and we've specified
its rotation. We've dimensioned two side lengths, which means that the
shape of the triangle is fully determined, side-angle-side. The ninety
degree vertex lies at the origin, so we've specified its translation.
This means that the triangle should be fully constrained, with zero
degrees of freedom, and that's what SolveSpace reports.
</p>

<p>
But in fact, three other solutions exist that would satisfy these
constraints. The horizontal edge could just as well go to the left as
to the right, and the vertical edge go down as up.
</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/constraints-ambiguous-2.png">
</div>

<p>
When the sketch is ambiguous, with finitely many possible solutions,
SolveSpace chooses among them according to the initial configuration of
the sketch. Before we placed our constraints, we had drawn our triangle
in the upper right quadrant. SolveSpace therefore chose the solution
with the triangle in that quadrant. If we had initially drawn the sketch
in a different quadrant, then SolveSpace would have chosen a different
solution.
</p>

<p>
A sketch of any complexity will almost always have multiple solutions.
Below, for example, we've drawn a five-sided figure, with equal side
lengths and with all of its vertices lying on a circle. We intended to
draw a regular pentagon.
</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/constraints-ambiguous-3.png">
</div>

<p>
But the solver might also return a five-pointed star, or a triangle with
one of the edges retraced twice, or five zero-length line segments at
a single point on the circle. The choice will depend on the initial
configuration of the sketch, so it's important to draw the sketch as
close as possible to the desired geometry before constraining it.
</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/constraints-ambiguous-4.png">
</div>

<p>
While dragging a point on a sketch, the solver may sometimes switch
from one solution to another. Sometimes this is desired, but other times
it is not. If the sketch "flips", then try dragging slower. This means
that the requested change will occur as several small changes, instead
of one large change. The solver is therefore able to return everything
to a valid configuration after each small change, and is more likely to
get the same solution each time.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, if an undesired "flip" occurs when changing a dimension,
then try making the change in multiple steps. For example, instead of
changing it from 1 to 2, change it from 1 to 1.5, and then 1.5 to 2. This
may be automated by choosing Analyze &rarr; Step Dimension.
</p>

<p>
Some constraints are more prone to multiple solutions than others.
Point-to-point distance (and, equivalently, line length) constraints tend
to generate multiple solutions; but point-line distance or point-face
distance constraints do not, since they internally operate on "signed
distance". This means that if a point is constrained to lie an inch above
a line, then the solver will not accept a solution with that point one
inch below the line. This reduces the number of possible solutions.
</p>

<p>
So far, we have been working entirely with constraints in the plane. We
happened to be drawing in the XY plane, as we might, for example, if
we were drawing a 2d part. But if we were drawing in some workplane in
a complex 3d part, then everything would behave identically, provided
that our constraints referenced only entities within that workplane.
</p>

<p>
But constraints can also apply in 3d, or to entities outside of our
workplane. Consider, for example, the part shown below. We've drawn a
trapezoidal sketch (with a hole in it) and extruded that, and we are
about to sketch onto the highlighted face of the resulting solid.
</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/constraints-projected-1.png">
</div>

<p>
We've drawn a line segment in our new sketch, which appears in white. We
wish to constrain it to have the same length as the line that's indicated
in red below. We can do that by selecting our new line, selecting the
red line, and choosing Constrain &rarr; Equal Length. If we do so, then
the two lines now appear to have the same length.
</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/constraints-projected-2.png">
</div>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/constraints-projected-3.png">
</div>

<p>
But if we rotate the view and look in 3d, then we see that the original
edge (which is highlighted in red below) is in fact much longer. It
appeared shorter only because of our view, where we were looking at
it almost on edge. The constraint operated on that projected length,
and not the true length of the lines.
</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/constraints-projected-4.png">
</div>

<p>
In many cases this is what's desired. For example, we may want to
constrain the two points indicated below to lie on top of each other, in
order to place our white line segment. Looking at the sketch in the
our workplane, this seems like a reasonable thing to do.
</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/constraints-projected-5.png">
</div>

<p>
But in fact, the lower point does not lie in our workplane. We're
sketching on the top of the trapezoid, and that's a point from the
bottom. This means that it would be impossible to make those two points
truly coincident. But since the point-coincident constraint applies
projected into our workplane, it will work as expected.
</p>

<p>
If we want to apply a constraint in 3d, and not projected into our
workplane, then we can choose Sketch &rarr; Anywhere in 3d. This will
cause constraints to apply in true 3d. So if we do that, and then delete
our equal-length constraint and recreate it, then we will end up with
a different result.
</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/constraints-projected-6.png">
</div>

<p>
Our line is now much longer; its length is equal to the actual length
of that other edge. Remember to switch back to the workplane (Sketch
&rarr; In Workplane) after creating the constraints in 3d. Otherwise,
we might create constraints or entities in 3d by accident. (By default,
when we're sketching in a workplane, a line, circle, or other entity will
be created in such a way that it always lies in that workplane. But when
we're sketching in 3d, the created entity will be entirely free. This
means that it will require more constraints to place it.)
</p>

<p>
Dimensions are generally used to drive the geometry. When we dimensioned
a line's length, for example, we wanted to change the length of that
line to whatever we indicated with the dimension. The dimension was an
input to the sketch.
</p>

<p>
In some cases, we might want the reverse: we might want the geometry to
drive the dimension, so that the dimension just indicates to us whatever
some length or angle happens to be. The dimension would in this case be
an output from the sketch. Such dimensions may be created, as reference
dimensions. To do so, first create the dimension normally. Then select
the dimension, and choose Constrain &rarr; Toggle Reference Dim.
</p>

<p>
Consider the sketch below. We've drawn two lines. We've placed a regular
dimension on the bottom line, and a reference dimension on the top one.
We are about to drag the point that's indicated in red.
</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/constraints-ref.png">
</div>

<p>
As we drag, the 1.000 inch dimension on the lower line will maintain that
line's length at one inch. That dimension will therefore not change. But
the reference dimension will change as we drag, to indicate whatever
length we've dragged that line to. Reference versions are available of
all dimensions, including length, angle, and length ratio.
